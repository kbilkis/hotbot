# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a web application that integrates git providers (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) with messaging providers (Slack, MS Teams, Discord) to send scheduled reminders about open pull requests. The system allows users to configure multiple cron jobs, each capable of reporting pull requests from different git providers to different messaging providers. The application consists of a modern landing page, a user dashboard for configuration, and a serverless lambda function that executes scheduled tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want to visit an appealing landing page, so that I can understand the value proposition and sign up for the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display a modern, visually appealing interface targeted at software engineers
2. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the git-messaging integration and cron scheduling features
3. WHEN a user clicks the sign-up button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the Clerk authentication flow
4. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to authenticate securely, so that I can access my personalized dashboard and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect unauthenticated users to the Clerk login page
2. WHEN a user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL create or update their user record in the database
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the landing page
4. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across page refreshes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to connect my git providers, so that the system can access my pull request data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display options to connect GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab accounts
2. WHEN a user clicks "Connect [Provider] App" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the provider's authorization page
3. WHEN a user completes authorization on the provider's website THEN the system SHALL receive an authorization code via callback and exchange it for access tokens
4. WHEN a user views connected providers THEN the system SHALL display the connection status and allow disconnection
5. IF a user's git provider token expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh the token automatically
6. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to connect my messaging providers, so that the system can send notifications to my preferred channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display options to connect Slack, MS Teams, and Discord accounts
2. WHEN a user clicks "Connect [Provider] App" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the provider's authorization page  
3. WHEN a user completes authorization on the provider's website THEN the system SHALL receive an authorization code via callback and exchange it for access tokens and channel information
4. WHEN a user views connected messaging providers THEN the system SHALL display available channels/rooms for notification delivery
5. IF a messaging provider token expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh the token automatically
6. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create and manage cron schedules, so that I can receive automated pull request reminders at my preferred times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the cron management interface THEN the system SHALL display a list of existing cron jobs
2. WHEN a user creates a new cron job THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify a cron expression (e.g., "0 9 \* \* \*" for daily at 9am)
3. WHEN a user configures a cron job THEN the system SHALL allow selection of a specific git provider and messaging provider combination
4. WHEN a user saves a cron job THEN the system SHALL validate the cron expression and provider configurations
5. WHEN a user edits an existing cron job THEN the system SHALL allow modification of schedule, git provider, and messaging provider
6. WHEN a user deletes a cron job THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and stop future executions
7. WHEN a user views cron jobs THEN the system SHALL display the next scheduled execution time for each job

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with configured cron jobs, I want the system to automatically check for pull requests and send notifications, so that I stay informed about pending reviews without manual checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lambda function executes THEN the system SHALL check for cron jobs scheduled to run within the current minute
2. WHEN a cron job is due for execution THEN the system SHALL fetch open pull requests from the configured git provider
3. WHEN pull requests are found THEN the system SHALL format them into a readable message
4. WHEN a message is prepared THEN the system SHALL send it to the configured messaging provider and channel
5. WHEN a cron job executes successfully THEN the system SHALL log the execution and update the last run timestamp
6. IF a cron job execution fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other jobs
7. WHEN no pull requests are found THEN the system SHALL optionally send a "no open PRs" message based on user preference

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize notification content and behavior, so that the messages are relevant and not overwhelming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures a cron job THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify which repositories to monitor
2. WHEN a user sets up notifications THEN the system SHALL allow them to choose whether to send messages when no PRs are found
3. WHEN formatting PR notifications THEN the system SHALL include PR title, author, creation date, and direct link
4. WHEN multiple PRs exist THEN the system SHALL group them in a single message to avoid spam
5. WHEN a user has no configured git or messaging providers THEN the system SHALL prevent cron job creation and display helpful guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter pull requests by attributes and set up escalation notifications, so that I can prioritize urgent items and ensure nothing gets missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures a cron job THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify pull request filters based on tags, labels, or title keywords
2. WHEN a user sets up PR filters THEN the system SHALL support filtering by attributes like "URGENT", "HOTFIX", or custom labels
3. WHEN a user configures a cron job THEN the system SHALL allow them to set up escalation notifications with a different messaging channel
4. WHEN a user sets escalation THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify the escalation timeframe (default 3 days)
5. WHEN a pull request remains open beyond the escalation timeframe THEN the system SHALL send notifications to the escalation channel
6. WHEN escalation notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that this is an escalated notification and include the time since PR creation
