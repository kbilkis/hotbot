# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a subscription-based pricing model using Stripe to monetize the git messaging scheduler application. The system will provide two tiers: a Free tier with limited functionality and a Pro tier with enhanced features and unlimited usage. This will enable sustainable revenue generation while providing value to users at different usage levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to start with a free tier so that I can evaluate the service before committing to a paid subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL automatically assign them to the Free tier
2. WHEN a user is on the Free tier THEN the system SHALL limit them to 1 git provider connection
3. WHEN a user is on the Free tier THEN the system SHALL limit them to 1 messaging provider connection
4. WHEN a user is on the Free tier THEN the system SHALL limit them to 1 schedule (cronjob)
5. WHEN a user creates a schedule on the Free tier THEN the system SHALL enforce a minimum interval of 24 hours between executions
6. WHEN a Free tier user attempts to exceed their limits THEN the system SHALL display an upgrade prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to upgrade to a Pro subscription so that I can use unlimited providers and schedules for my business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user upgrades to Pro THEN the system SHALL charge $15 per month via Stripe
2. WHEN a user is on the Pro tier THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited git provider connections
3. WHEN a user is on the Pro tier THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited messaging provider connections
4. WHEN a user is on the Pro tier THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited schedules (cronjobs)
5. WHEN a user is on the Pro tier THEN the system SHALL allow schedules with any frequency (no 24-hour minimum)
6. WHEN a Pro subscription is active THEN the system SHALL display "Pro" status in the user interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my subscription so that I can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses subscription settings THEN the system SHALL display their current tier and billing information
2. WHEN a Free user clicks upgrade THEN the system SHALL redirect to Stripe Checkout for Pro subscription
3. WHEN a Pro user wants to cancel THEN the system SHALL provide a cancellation option through Stripe Customer Portal
4. WHEN a Pro subscription is cancelled THEN the system SHALL maintain Pro features until the end of the billing period
5. WHEN a Pro subscription expires THEN the system SHALL automatically downgrade the user to Free tier
6. WHEN downgrading to Free tier THEN the system SHALL disable excess providers and schedules beyond Free limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want webhook handling for subscription events so that the application stays synchronized with Stripe billing changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Stripe sends a subscription webhook THEN the system SHALL verify the webhook signature
2. WHEN a subscription is created THEN the system SHALL update the user's tier to Pro
3. WHEN a subscription is cancelled or expires THEN the system SHALL update the user's tier to Free
4. WHEN a payment fails THEN the system SHALL log the event and maintain current access until retry period expires
5. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error for manual review

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visibility of my usage limits so that I understand what I can do with my current tier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their current tier prominently
2. WHEN a Free user views providers THEN the system SHALL show usage count (e.g., "1/1 Git Providers")
3. WHEN a Free user views schedules THEN the system SHALL show usage count (e.g., "1/1 Schedules")
4. WHEN a user approaches their limits THEN the system SHALL display warning messages
5. WHEN a user exceeds Free tier limits THEN the system SHALL disable the "Add" buttons and show upgrade prompts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for payment failures so that users have a smooth experience even when payments fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Stripe payment fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a subscription creation fails THEN the system SHALL not upgrade the user's tier
3. WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL handle retries gracefully
4. WHEN Stripe is unavailable THEN the system SHALL maintain current user access and log the issue
5. WHEN payment method expires THEN the system SHALL notify the user via email (if configured)
